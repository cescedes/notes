#estimate the p-value for a binomial hypothesis test with the following null and alternative hypotheses:

#Null: the probability of a purchase was 10%
#Alternative: the probability of a purchase rate was LESS THAN 10%
#In other words, calculate the proportion of values in null_outcomes that are less than or equal to 41 (the observed number of purchases that we calculated earlier)
#calculate the p-value here:
null_outcomes = np.array(null_outcomes)
p_value = np.sum(null_outcomes <= 41)/len(null_outcomes)

##
#Calculating a Two-Sided P-Value
#calculate the p-value for a two-sided test (alternative hypothesis is that the purchase probability was DIFFERENT FROM 10%). 
#Remember that, if the purchase rate is 10%, we expect 50 of the 500 visitors to make a purchase.
#in other words, calculate the proportion of values in null_outcomes that are less than or equal to 41 (the number of purchases we observed in our sample, which is 9 fewer than 50) 
#OR greater than or equal to 59 (which is 9 purchases more than 50). 
#calculate the p-value here:
null_outcomes = np.array(null_outcomes)
p_value = np.sum((null_outcomes <= 41) | (null_outcomes >= 59))/len(null_outcomes)
